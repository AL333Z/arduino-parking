# arduino-parking
A parking lot management system, implemented with Arduino and Raspberry pi.

This project is an attempt to focus on a paradigmatic and engineering point of view in developping embedded systems.

##This is still a WIP, so you may wait some days until i complete a decent documentation. Or, if yuo are an haker, just look at the code <3
